Ruby interface with Tesla Motors REST API

Status
------

* WebApi data logging has been logging actively 24/7 for about 6 months and is now very stable
* Streaming seems to work, but is not actively used
	
TODO
----

### WebApi

* Create Vehicle class rather than taking <id> as a parameter to the Api class
* Better saved cookie handling
* Better class names, modules, or both

### Streaming

* Method to terminate yield loop
